Timeline: 4 weeks of coding

Week 1 (Alpha): Meet on the 23rd, Wednesday 7 PM MST (Backup: 1 PM MST)
No sprites yet
Learn arcade module
Singleplayer (square sprite)
Movement works
Dies from hitting wall

Week 2 (Beta):
General improvements
Implement trails
Trail can be collided with
ai
module docstrings

Week 3 (Release):
General improvements
Miguel Sprites:
    Resize sprites to actual size? (they are currently 3 times too large)
    Resize wall.png to a square (40px sides)
    Create 6 total version (full border, one side missing, two corner sides missing, 3 sides missing, all sides missing, 2 opposite sides missing)
Convert wall lists into spritelists, (use_spatial_hash and is_static for non-moving objects) (Ethan)
Two Player (Ethan)
Fix ai collision (Ethan)
Maps (Rich and Ethan)
Add map collision checking (Rich and Ethan)
Sounds (Hunter and Avery)
    Collision with walls
    General background (music)
Tests:
    trail (Miguel)
    player (Avery)
    lightbike (Rich)
    ai (Ethan)


Week 4 (Stable):
General improvements (optimizations)
Make wall sprites more consistent with each other (Miguel)
Bugtesting

Main menu (Hunter and Miguel) (https://arcade.academy/examples/view_instructions_and_game_over.html)
    Create main menu loosely based on the plan in assets (feel free to come up with your own ideas for how it looks)
    Connect button code to editing the variables for cur_map, num_players, and num_ai
    Create button (Ethan)

Move game over to game_view, adjust game.py to work with both screens (Ethan)
Particle effects on collision (Ethan and Rich) (https://arcade.academy/examples/particle_systems.html)
Add particle docstrings (Rich)
